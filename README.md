# RANK-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the rank of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
Step 1:

Import the required library NumPy using import numpy as np.

Step 2:

Define or input the matrix for which the rank has to be calculated.

Step 3:

Use the built-in function np.linalg.matrix_rank() to compute the rank of the given matrix.

Step 4:

Display the rank of the matrix as the output.
## Program:
```
#Program to find the rank of a matrix.

import numpy as np
print(np.linalg.matrix_rank([[1,2,3],[3,6,9]]))
```
## Output:
